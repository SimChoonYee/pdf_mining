I have a pdf file with roughly 300 pages, most of which contain a a new crew ID number, name, table, etc.
See first page of attached PDF. Other pages, are continuations of the previous page,
and don't contain a crew ID number- see second page of attached PDF.
My task is to parse the master pdf, and create smaller, sub PDF's saving each by the crew ID # of the page.
Pages without a crew ID that are continuations of the previous page, those resembling the second page of
attached PDF should be added and saved to the PDF before it with a crew ID number.
Each crew ID number is 6 digits, beginning with a 0. This can be identified with regex.

I am trying to use PyPDF2 to parse the master PDF, but am having trouble doing so with regex,
and with creating sub-PDF's containing more than one page.

Any help here?? Thanks python community!
